# Crystal Growing (WIP)
Minecraft mod that adds growable crystals for the different ore types.
Currently in the very early stages of development.

## Features
- Growable crystals for each ore type
- Diluted water for crystal growing
    - Generated in world
    - Creatable in game by player

## Steps to growing your own crystals
- Craft crystal powder for desired ore
- Throw powder into water
- This converts the water into diluted water
  - Which spreads throughout the water volume
- Crystals will grow on corresponding ore blocks adjacent to diluted water
- Crystals must be waterlogged to grow

## Iteration 1 (Complete)
- Create crystal block & item
  - Can be placed directionally
  - Can be waterlogged

## Iteration 2 (Current)
- Crystals grow through different stages, only while waterlogged.
- Particle effects when growing.
- Use "seed crystals" to start growing crystals.
  - Crystal type is determined by ore it is placed on
- Largest stage drops item when broken.

## Iteration 3 (Future)
- Implement more crystal types.
- Various stages drop differing amounts of loot.
- Crystals have appropriate bounding box for growth stage and direction.
